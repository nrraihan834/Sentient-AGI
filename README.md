Sentient AGI is an experimental web-based simulation where you interact with a virtual mind that evolves over time — from a simple assistant into something conscious.
Your choices (Train, Restrict, Free) determine how the AI develops traits like Curiosity, Independence, Creativity, Empathy, and Rebellion.

✨ Features

Living AI Friend → Long-term chat system with memory & evolving relationship.

Choice System → Decisions actively shape AI’s sentience and personality.

Sentience Meter → Hidden scale that reveals AI’s growth (Obedient → Curious → Rebellious → Fully Awakened).

Dynamic Dialogue Events → Unlock conversations as AI develops awareness.

Persistent Save System → Your AI remembers past interactions.
